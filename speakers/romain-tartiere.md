Hi! I'm Romain Tartière and you're currently browsing the sub-part of the Internet where I introduce myself and host a few projects.

By day, I was a systems administrator for HealthGrid, an association which aimed to bring grid technologies to health and healthcare-related structures. Since the liquidation of the association, I am in the process of a Validation des Acquis de l'Experience.

By night, I am a FreeBSD enthusiast involved in Free/Libre Software activities and interested in various computer-science related technologies (and sometimes sleep a bit).
